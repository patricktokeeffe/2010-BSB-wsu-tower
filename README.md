Wind Tower Data Acquisition Program
===================================

Wind Measurements on Big Southern Butte (2010)
----------------------------------------------

This CRBasic program was used to record high-frequency sonic anemometer data 
during a complex terrain wind study on Big Southern Butte, ID in 2010. 
Post-processing was headed by the [Missoula Firelab](http://www.firelab.org):

> Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory  
> Rocky Mountain Research Station  
> United States Forest Service  
>
> Primary contact: Bret Butler <bwbutler@fs.fed.us>

The [Air Resources Laboratory - Field Research Division](http://www.noaa.inel.gov/)
(within NOAA) was also a collaborator on this study. Their designated contact 
person is:

> Dennis Finn  
> 1750 Foote Dr.  
> Idaho Falls, ID 83402  
> <Dennis.Finn@noaa.gov>
