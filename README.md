Wind Tower Data Acquisition Program
===================================

Wind Measurements on Big Southern Butte (2010)
----------------------------------------------

This CRBasic program was used to record high-frequency sonic anemometer data 
during a complex terrain wind study on Big Southern Butte, ID in 2010. 
A collaboration with the [Missoula Firelab](http://www.firelab.org) and
the NOAA [Air Resources Laboratory - Field Research Division](http://www.noaa.inel.gov/).
