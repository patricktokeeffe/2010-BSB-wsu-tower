Wind Tower Data Acquisition Program
===================================

Wind Measurements on Big Southern Butte (2010)
----------------------------------------------

This CRBasic program was used to record high-frequency sonic anemometer data 
during a complex terrain wind study on Big Southern Butte, ID in 2010. 
Post-processing was headed by the [Missoula Firelab](http://www.firelab.org):

> Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory
> Rocky Mountain Research Station
> United States Forest Service
>
> Primary contact: Bret Butler <bwbutler@fs.fed.us>
